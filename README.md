# Terrafile

This gem provides a `terrafile` executable (Ruby) to install a Terraform project's modules using `git`. 

The idea of using a 'Terrafile' (like a 'Puppetfile' or a 'Gemfile') to manage a project's dependencies comes from Ben Snape and this code is largely taken from his blog post [http://bensnape.com/2016/01/14/terraform-design-patterns-the-terrafile/](http://bensnape.com/2016/01/14/terraform-design-patterns-the-terrafile/).

Conventions:

- a project's modules are described in a `Terrafile` located at the root of the project
- terraform modules are installed in `vendor/terraform_modules`   


## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'terrafile'
```

And then execute:

    $ bundle

Or install it yourself as:

    $ gem install terrafile

## Usage

Invoke the executable from your shell:

    $ terrafile

to install the modules listed in `Terrafile` into `vendor/terraform_modules`.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. Then, run `rake spec` to run the tests. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).

### Installing gem in development

- `gem build terrafile.gemspec`
- `gem install terrafile-*.gem`

Then you can run `$ terrafile` to run the latest version
